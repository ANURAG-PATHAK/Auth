# Technical Requirement Document: Stock Trading Application

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a full-featured stock trading application using Next.js with the app router, PostgreSQL, and Prisma as the ORM. The application will include user authentication, real-time stock data, trade execution, and portfolio management. The frontend will be built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS and Shad-cn components. The backend will be developed from scratch, following the MVC model and modern software architecture principles.
